# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Overview:
A sentimental analysis conducted on the most sentimental person, one of my favourite guitarists from Queen, Brian May [brianmayforreal Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brianmayforreal/?hl=en)

## Data Source
1. Twitter: You can apply for API at [Twitter For Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
2. Instagram no longer provides public API. I used the automatic scraper developed by [APIFY](https://apify.com/) instead.
The dataset I used in this project is his instagram posts, dated from 

## First Try:
>Because Twitter would automatically repost his Instagram postsï¼ŒTwitter has public API, and IG doesn't

>First I decided to just analyze on his Twitter posts to avoid the complication of dealing with mannually scrapying from Instagram.
>However, after I got the data from Twitter's API, I realized twitter don't always repost the complete text. Many long posts are replaced by a hyperlink redirecting readers to original posts, which caused error in my analysis results.

>So, I have to go with the original posts on Instagram.
